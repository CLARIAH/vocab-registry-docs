# Context
The SSH Vocab Registry (LINK) is built in the context of the "Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud" project (SSHOC.nl), which develops state of the art infrastructure for social science and humanities research. This registry is a one-stop reference service for vocabularies that are relevant to researchers, developers, data managers or curators in the humanities and social sciences (SSH) communities.
