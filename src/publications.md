## About FAIR vocabularies
We have created a Zotero group to share a curated bibliography of relevant publications related to the concepts, creation, (re)use and publication of FAIR vocabularies in the SSH domains. The group is publicly accessible here:
https://www.zotero.org/groups/5970044/fair_vocabularies_learn/library
If you would like to suggest a new resource to add to this library, please create a github issue with your suggestion: toDo or request to be included as member of the Zotero group via (toDo).
