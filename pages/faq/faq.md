# Frequently Asked Questions

# What's the connection with Termennetwerk?
- Written by Menzo on November 2024 (to review)
    - the termennetwerk is a federated search engine on top of cultural heritage (SKOS) vocabs
    - the registry is broader, but once enough facets and APIs are in place one could "mimic" a similar approach, i.e. filter on all SKOS vocabs AND all vocabs relevant for the cultural heritage domain and get their SKOSMOS endpoints or Named graphs
    - the termennetwerk and NDE put a lot of effort in getting relevant vocabs into SKOS and to get collection management software companies to add support for the termennetwerk-based functionality into their products â€¦ we take what is already there , but might also register the (SKOS) vocabs that are in the termennetwerk at some point

# Who can add vocabularies?

# Who determines if a vocabulary is published?
See "curation page"

# Who maintains this software?

# What's the connection with SSHOC marketplace?

# How does it relate to other vocabulary registries?
There are other vocabulary registries in place which are a valuable point of reference for finding vocabularies in these domains (e.g., Bartoc, or LOV). What distinguishes the CLARIAH FAIR vocabulary registry from similar international initiatives is that it aims to:
- (1) do semi-automatic curation work, which include automatic processes in the selection and processing, but also involves experts in the selection and curation of the vocabularies,
- (2) work towards the formalization of the characteristics that make a vocabulary FAIR, aiming to provide guidelines to the creators of the vocabularies to increase their FAIR-ness,
- (3) serve a specific user group (i.e., humanities and social science researchers), which gives advantages when selecting vocabularies to include and datasets to link to; also to have a closer relation with users during the development and evaluation of the registry;
- (4) widen the scope to make room for vocabularies that are not only RDF-based;
- (5) find relations between the vocabularies and the dataset registries used by these communities to see which vocabularies were used in those datasets (to get statistics about vocabulary use), it will collect user reviews, and provide recommendations to encourage vocabulary reuse.
