# SSH FAIR Vocabulary Registry: Documentation and guidelines

[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

# Introduction

This repository contains code and content of one of the components of the FAIR vocabulary registry (i.e., the vocabulary guidelines and the SSH FAIR vocabulary registry's user documentation).

The FAIR Vocabulary Registry for the Humanities and Social Sciences (SSH) is built in the context of the "Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud" project ([SSHOC-NL](https://sshoc.nl/)). This project develops state-of-the-art infrastructure for researchers, in collaboration between [ODISSEI](https://odissei-data.nl/) (Open Data Infrastructure for Social Science and Economic Innovations) and [CLARIAH](https://www.clariah.nl/) (Common Lab Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities).

The SSH FAIR Vocabulary Registry is a one-stop reference service for vocabularies that are relevant to researchers, developers, data managers or curators working on improving the FAIR-ness of research data in the SSH research communities, mostly in the context of SSHOC-NL. It aims to support them in finding, (re)using, publishing and adding vocabularies to the registry.

You are here in one of the repositories that form part of [the architecture](https://registry.vocabs.clariah.nl/about/) of the SSH FAIR vocabulary registry. This specific repository contains the code and content of the user documentation and guidelines. The vocabulary registry's documentation is meant to explain the context of the project and to provide end-user support. The guidelines, on the other hand, are a more general gateway to the world of controlled vocabularies, providing definitions to the main concepts, as well as indication on how to create, publish, reuse and distribute vocabularies in research contexts in the social sciences and humanities.

# Working with the code as contributor
This repository can be used by any collaborator who wants to be part of the construction of the SSH vocabulary guidelines. Currently, this editing process is moderated by the maintainers of this repository (see contact information below).
The documentation repository is built using a static website editor called Eleventy (). If you would like to contribute to the guidelines, you have two options:
- Option1: run this repository locally:
  - clone the repository
  - use any text editor of your preference to edit the content
  - run `npx @11ty/eleventy --serve` if you want to test locally
- Option2: edit the Github static pages directly:
  - go to the Github repository page you want to edit (for example, the ["reusing" vocabularies page](https://github.com/CLARIAH/vocab-registry-docs/blob/main/src/guidelines/reuse.md)), you can either use the Github's IDE for editing that single file, or using your preferred text editor locally.
- As last step for any of the two options above,create a pull request to the main branch of the repository (for small changes), or make your own branch (for mayor contributions). The moderators of the vocabulary's documentation will then review your contribution and reply via Github, or contact you for more details if you provide your contact information.
