# SSH FAIR Vocabulary Registry

The SSH FAIR Vocabulary Registry is a registry of vocabularies that are relevant for the Humanities and Social Sciences.
It aims to provide a single point of access to find, evaluate, and reuse vocabularies in these domains. The registry is
part of the SSHOC project and is developed by the CLARIAH project.
