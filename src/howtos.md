# How To Dos

# How to use the vocabulary registry:
## Searching/browsing
If you want to use the registry for searching and browsing you can make use of the vocabulary registry right away in the resulting web portal for the registry, here: https://registry.vocabs.dev.clariah.nl/ (this is a development version). This registry is a search and browsing interface for the selected vocabularies. You can use the search query to find vocabularies relevant to your search per keywords in the title or descriptions. You can use the different facets to filter the results per type of vocabulary, and other characteristics.
