# About the SSH FAIR Vocabulary Registry

Welcome to the FAIR Vocabulary Registry for the Humanities and Social Sciences (SSH FAIR VOCABULARIES), built in the context of the "Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud" project (SSHOC.nl), which develops state of the art infrastructure for social science and humanities research in collaboration between ODISSEI (Open Data Infrastructure for Social Science and Economic Innovations) and CLARIAH (Common Lab Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities). This registry is a one-stop reference service for vocabularies that are relevant to researchers, developers, data managers or curators in the humanities and social sciences (SSH) communities.

The vocabulary registry aligns to other international initiatives that aim to increase the FAIR-ness ("Findability", "Accessibility", "Reproducibility" and "Interoperability") of research data and cultural heritage metadata, in this case with a focus on vocabularies (see Guidelines-Concepts for a definition of these terms).
