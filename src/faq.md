# Frequently Asked Questions

## What's the connection with the "Network of Terms" ("Termennetwerk")?

- The "[Network of Terms](https://termennetwerk.netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/nl)", is a federated search engine on top of cultural heritage (SKOS) vocabularies. It is a service created and maintained by the Network Digital Heritage ([NDE](https://netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/)) which aggregates vocabularies crated and used in the heritage sector.
- The SSH Vocabulary Registry is different (broader) than the Network of Terms because it also registers schema vocabularies, not value vocabularies only; but it also includes some value vocabularies.
- The Network of Terms includes mostly vocabularies from the heritage sector, while the SSH Vocabulary Registry (mostly) includes vocabularies from the SSH research domain.
- The Network of Terms and NDE put a lot of effort in getting relevant vocabularies into SKOS and to get collection management software companies to add support for the Network of Terms-based functionality into their products. The SSH Vocabulary Registry also aims to include non RDF-based vocabularies.
